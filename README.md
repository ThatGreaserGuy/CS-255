The center of CS-255 revolved around a fictional system called DriverPass.  The concept behind DriverPass was that its owner, Liam, wanted a new system that would aid in driver training.  He noticed more people than necessary failing their driving tests at the DMV and proposed his company and his system DriverPass to provide more easily accessible learning and training to students via the online system as well as on-the-road training scheduled through the system.

Liam wanted DriverPass to be accessible via the software and online interaction in web browsers.  He also wanted it to be run on servers and over the cloud for minimal maintenance on his company's end.

I feel that I visualized the elements of the system really well within the different types of diagrams included.  While they were tedious to make and information overlapped, they provided vital perspectives to the system's functionalities.  The various types I created for the client were Class, Activity, Sequence, and Use Case diagrams.

On the flip side, while I think I did a decent job, I would go back and adjust the system requirements portion of the project.  I would improve it firstly by really figuring out what constitutes as nonfunctional and functional requirements, and what is important to include or mention versus what is not.  That was some of the more difficult thinking necessary to complete the project that was left with a comfortable level of confusion at the end.

Perceiving Liam's needs as individual objects and functionalities helped translate the requested aspects into the project's implementation within the diagrams.  I was helpful, albeit hard to understand, listing the functionalities and analyzing the system requirements as it painted light on some objects or functionalities that otherwise would have been left in the dark and forgotten in the diagramming segment.  Developing through this part and moving through the diagrams, I feel that his needs and desires were not only met but also served a sound design.

It is vital to consider the user's needs when designing.  Firstly, it makes sure their needs are forefront to the project's mission and are subsequently met come its completion.  Secondly, though, as mentioned in the previous paragraph, keeping the user's needs in mind will serve a sound design of the project that will have very little — preferably, no — cracks in its functionalities.

I approach designing software from a visual, segmented perspective.  Taking the desires and splitting them into their building blocks, though tedious at times, is my personal best way to tackle these kinds of projects correctly and to the highest degree of quality.  I would like to develop more skill in listing out requirements for a system.  I feel that this is an important foundational aspect to further development that shouldn't ever be overlooked because it really spells out how you will enter the deeper developmental periods.  Really segmenting the development cycle into its various aspects and equally divvying up attention and thought to the aspects is the strategy I will strive to master.
